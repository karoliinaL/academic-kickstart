# Biography

I am currently a Research Associate at the University of Liverpool on the project ``Solving parity games in theory and practice". I moved here from Kiel, Germany, where I spent two years as a postdoc in Dirk Nowotka's Dependable Systems group. My primary research interests are logic, infinite games and automata theory, in particular in the context of verification and descriptive complexity.
